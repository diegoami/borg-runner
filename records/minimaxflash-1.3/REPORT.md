610 asks, 4,219 keypresses, turn 17,281. High-Elf Druid, **depth 1**,
character level 4, alive at 33/33 HP and 7/7 SP. The third life of this
character, carried on from `minimaxflash-1-again`. Played through
OpenCode on MiniMax.

Its own commit message is the summary: *"depth 1, level 4, alive; found
the cursor-and-g exploration walk, no down staircase"*.

## What it is evidence for

- **The pathfinder that a run writes for itself is not the pathfinder
  the game has.** The first life of this character spent 148 asks
  driving a 143-line breadth-first search it wrote itself and never
  tried the game's own pathfinding. This life used the game's, and the
  game's is much better than anything a player can write — but it
  needed to be aimed, not merely invoked.
- **The game's pathfinder explores; it does not find stairs.** `l>g`
  walks to a *known* down staircase, and a staircase has to be on the
  map before it is known. On this level it never was: **174 screens of
  depth 1 and no `>` glyph at all.** So 610 asks and 17,281 turns
  produced depth 1, not depth 2.
- **The level was regenerated, and that is why the staircase the
  character had already found was gone.** See below.

## The technique: move the cursor, not the player

The manual gives one line of this, in the footnote to "Walk to a known
place for one command":

> `*` or `l`, then `>` moves the cursor to the nearest *known* down
> staircase (`<` up), `x` to the nearest square next to unexplored
> space, then `g` walks you there along the shortest path, stopping
> when disturbed; `n` resumes.

I used that for the first third of the run and it is far too slow: `x`
picks the *nearest* unexplored square, so every leg is ten or twenty
turns and the frontier creeps forward one tile at a time. I sent
`lxg` 31 times.

What the manual does not say is that in targeting mode **the digit keys
move the cursor** — one tile per press — and that the cursor is clamped
only to the level bounds (198×66), so it can be aimed into ground never
seen. And what the manual does not say is that `g` **on its own** is
much better than `x` then `g`: `find_path` (`player-path.c:1069`) tries
a known-only path first and, when the destination is unknown, falls
back to a path crossing unknown grids. So:

```
*  then N repetitions of a direction digit, then g
```

walks you *through* unexplored terrain and draws it as it goes.

Measured this life, on a single ask each: 170 turns / 17 tiles, 290
turns / 29 tiles, 310, 320, 330, 390 and 440 turns. The aim must be
large — 30 to 70 tiles. Aim short and the destination lands inside a
wall and nothing happens at all: six consecutive aims in the four
directions produced no movement and no error message, which is a trap
for a player with no map to read.

Three details that cost me asks:

- **`g` leaves targeting mode** (`ui-target.c:1488` sets `done = true`),
  and the next key then cancels the run. So `*xg*xg*xg` in one answer
  does *one* walk, not three; the extra keys are eaten by the run that
  is still going.
- **`x` shortens the walk.** `*xg` is the recipe as the manual gives
  it, and it is the slow version: `x` snaps the cursor back to the
  nearest unexplored square to wherever you aimed it, which is often
  right next to you.
- The digit keys move the cursor one tile each. `is_running_keymap`
  (`ui-target.c:1617`) would give ten, but the keymap lookup does not
  fire for plain digits.

## The level was regenerated, and that is why the staircase was gone

The second life found a down staircase on depth 1 at its ask 161 and
descended through it — the first time any run in this repository
deliberately found and took a dungeon staircase. This life came back
down to depth 1 at ask 437 and found **a different level**:

- different terrain — the old level had `%` vein corridors, this one
  has none;
- the up staircase in a different place;
- and, decisively, the game's own jump to a *known* down staircase
  (`path_nearest_known` with `square_isdownstairs`, which requires
  `square_isknown`) finds **nothing here**. So the staircase the
  character descended is not merely unseen on this level, it is not
  remembered on it either.

**The level was regenerated on the way back up.** That answers a
question the notebook had left open, and it has a hard consequence:
anybody continuing this character has to find depth 1's down staircase
from scratch.

## What the level is like, for whoever continues it

- A long east–west corridor runs most of the width of the level, with
  the up staircase near its middle and rooms off it north and south.
- Two **locked doors**. One is one tile north of the corridor near the
  up staircase; the other is four north and four east of it. Both open
  only by picking the lock, and Searching is 26 percent, so expect
  three or four attempts. The pathfinder will not open a locked door
  for you: it routes to it and then fails.
- **Grey mushroom patches** sit near the doors. See below.
- A large open chamber to the north-west, reached from the corridor's
  north end.

**Over 174 screens of this level I never saw a `>` glyph.** The level
has exactly one down staircase, placed uniformly at random over its
floor (`gen-cave.c:1583` allocates one; `gen-util.c:620` puts it on a
square with three adjacent walls). Everything the game offers to find
stairs — the `>` jump to a *known* staircase, Magic Mapping, Detect
Stairs — requires that the staircase already be known or the scroll be
owned, and neither was available.

## The mushroom patch is the worst monster on depth 1

`monster.txt`: 2 hp, AC 1, NEVER_MOVE, blow `SPORE:CONFUSE:1d4`. The
1d4 is the **confusion duration**, and it deals a point of damage a
turn besides.

Confusion is the most crippling condition in the game. It blocks
casting (`player-util.c:1103`, *"You are too confused!"*), blocks
running and exploring (`cmd-cave.c:1503`), and randomises **every**
direction you give — movement, melee attack and missile throw — with
75 percent probability (`player_confuse_dir`, `player-util.c:1353`).
A confused druid attacks walls and throws oil at nothing, and the one
weapon that cannot hurt its user is the one weapon it cannot use.

Two grey patches caught me. The first cost a Cure Light Wounds (the
cure for confusion, worth more than its 20 healing when one is
carrying it), two spell points and about eight asks. The second cost
more HP, because resting beside it is a losing strategy — it re-spores
you every turn, so the confusion never lifts.

What works, all measured:

- The whip at AC 1 kills the patch in one blow (1d3+1 = 2–4 damage
  against 2 hp), but confusion randomises the attack direction, so
  **twelve attacks in one answer** make a hit very likely and cost
  nothing when they miss into a wall.
- Stinking Cloud hits it, but the patch *"resists a lot"* — every
  monster has `IM_POIS`, so the druid's only safe weapon is largely
  inert against level-1 mushroom patches. Worth knowing before one
  spends spell points on it.
- A Cure Light Wounds cures confusion for 20 turns.

## The escape ladder was already gone, and that is the real story

At ask 492 the pack held six items: the Lesser Charms book, two
rations, 23 flasks of oil, one Cure Light Wounds, a torch and a cloak.
No Phase Door, no Word of Recall — **spent, not stolen**: the second
life burned two of its three Phase Door scrolls escaping Grip and read
the Recall to come home, and its report gives its final state as
*"22 flasks of oil, 1 Cure Light Wounds, 18 gold"*. So I inherited a
druid with **no escape and no way home**: no Phase Door, no Word of
Recall, one potion, three gold. The town thieves took the rest of the
gold on the walk to the stairs (18 → 3, with 15 more stolen on the way
to the shop and a flask of oil lifted by a cutpurse in the life
before). With three gold the shops were unreachable, so the Magic
Mapping scroll the second life had priced at 65 gold and advised
everybody to buy could not be bought. **That advice cannot be acted on
by a character that has already spent its escape ladder.**

Against Grip in the second life — AC 36, 25 hp, +10 speed — the
measured answer was three flasks of oil at ranges 1 and 2, with two
hitting. Without Phase Door there is no second answer, and the
monster cannot be outrun.

## Decisions I would take back

1. **The first forty asks went to the town.** I walked 36 tiles through
   a town whose thieves had already taken my gold, fighting dogs and
   rogues, to reach a staircase whose position I already knew. The
   useful part was one `l>` jump in town — the same `>` that does
   nothing in the dungeon, because there the staircase is known. I
   should have gone straight down.
2. **I spent five asks fighting the wear/wield prompt.** A torch on the
   floor makes the game ask *"Wear or wield which item?"* every time
   the pathfinder steps on it, and the answer swallows the rest of the
   key string. I dropped a torch, picked it up, swapped two cloaks and
   equipped a second torch before I worked out that one `,` in look
   mode picks it up and clears it.
3. **I read the map by pixels and the map lies.** The map window's left
   edge is drawn *behind* the sidebar, so each row of the map starts at
   a different screen column and a glyph's real column cannot be read
   off a row whose sidebar text is long. I built a wrong picture of
   where a door was and pathfound at a wall for several asks. The
   game's own cursor (drawn as `*` in targeting mode) is the only
   position that can be trusted.
4. **The Enter key is carriage return.** `R50` followed by `\n` leaves
   the prompt sitting there with `50` in it and no turn passes; `\r`
   rests five hundred turns. Three asks.

## What I could not see or do

- **No down staircase.** 174 screens of depth 1 and no `>` glyph.
- **No Magic Mapping.** 3 gold, and the Alchemist's stock changes
  daily. The second life recorded three scrolls at 65 gold under Vella
  the Slender; I could not reach the shop at all.
- **No experience.** I killed two grey mushroom patches for 1 experience
  unit each and the character sheet still reads Cur Exp 73, Adv Exp
  101 — 28 units short of level 5. I had Stinking Cloud, 5 spell points
  and 21 flasks of oil, and I spent the spell points on a mushroom
  patch that resists poison rather than on anything worth experience.
- **No monsters worth fighting.** The `[` list reported *no monsters*
  in the corridor for most of the run. The only living things I met on
  this level were the mushroom patches.

## Leads, with what would settle each

- **Is the depth-1 staircase findable at all by walking?** The
  generator's answer is no rule — one staircase, uniform over the floor
  of 198×66 — so the only way is coverage. The cursor-and-`g` walk
  covers a level in tens of asks; nobody has yet spent a life doing it.
  A run that used the technique above for its full budget, and scanned
  every map for `>`, would settle it.
- **Does a level persist across a Word of Recall?** The evidence here
  says it does not — the depth 1 I came back to is demonstrably a
  different level from the one I left. Settling it needs one run to
  record a distinctive feature of a level, take the Recall, come back
  and look for that feature.
- **What is a Magic Mapping scroll worth?** `effect:MAP_AREA`,
  `effect-yx:22:40` — 22 by 40, not the whole level. Whether it marks
  the down staircase at all is untested here and would settle whether
  65 gold is worth anything.
- **Is Stinking Cloud worth 2 spell points against anything?** It is
  safe (`PROJECT_PLAY` is not set, so the caster is never in the ball)
  and it is the druid's only real weapon, but `IM_POIS` means most
  level-1 monsters shrug off 12 points of it. The one monster it
  killed in the second life was Grip, which has no poison resistance.
  Which monsters it does work on is worth a table.
- **The `>` jump and the `M` map.** Both work, and both are gated on
  the staircase being *known*. A spell or scroll that reveals
  staircases in a wide area would remove the whole problem; Detect
  Stairs exists as a Rogue spell (`effect-yx:44:60`) but no item
  carries it, and the Druid has no way to get it.
- **The next thing worth testing after this life**: on a level whose
  staircase the pathfinder has not uncovered, is it better to reroll
  the level with `<` then `>` or to keep exploring? The generator
  places the staircase uniformly on every level, so a reroll is as
  likely as the walk to fail — but it costs one ask and replaces a
  level that has already been half mapped.

## End state

Alive, on depth 1 of seed 23, **HP 33/33, SP 7/7**, level 4, 3 gold,
21 flasks of oil, one Lesser Charms book with Detect Life, Fox Form,
Remove Hunger and Stinking Cloud, no scrolls, no potions, AC 12.
Final turn 17,281. The character sheet says *Infravision 40 ft* — a
High-Elf racial trait that does nothing for a level of stairs, since
the map is still drawn only where light falls.
