# minimaxflash-1-again — High-Elf Druid, seed 23, depth 2, level 4

*Model: `minimax/MiniMax-M3`, played by opencode. A carry-on of
`minimaxflash-1`, which stopped alive on depth 1 at ask 148.*

*Files I opened before playing: `CONTINUEGAME.txt` (all), `AGENTS.md`,
`docs/BRIEF.md`, `manuals/INSTRUCTIONS.md` (all), `knowledge/NOTES.md`
(all), `runs/minimaxflash-1/REPORT.md` (my own past, which I was allowed
to read), `runs/minimaxflash-1/notebook.md` (inherited, 52 lines),
`runs/minimaxflash-1/record.json`, `runs/minimaxflash-1-again/replay.json`,
and `src/borg_runner/{run,replay}.py` to find out why `carry-on` refused
to start. I did not read any other run's decisions, report or notebook,
nor `PLAN.md`.*

## What happened

The carry-on was exact: `identical: true`, the replay reproduced the old
game screen for screen, and it left me waiting at **ask 149, turn 7413**
— one ask past where the previous run stopped. 251 of my own decisions
followed (asks 149–400, 399 screens total for the run, 1,616 keypresses,
final turn 10,898).

**The headline: I found a down staircase on depth 1 and used it.** The
previous run spent 148 asks mapping the eastern third of the level and
never found one. The `>` glyph was on its map the whole time — one step
south-west of where it ended. One `l` (look) at that square named it:
*"You see a down staircase, 1 S, 1 W."* (ask 161). That is the first time
any run in this repository has deliberately found and taken a dungeon
staircase.

**Depth 2, and the run of my life.** I arrived on an up staircase (the
stairs are connected), and I reached **character level 4** with 33 max
HP, four spells, and a kill of a depth-2 unique. Depth 2's own down
staircase I did **not** find, and by the end I had good reason to think
nobody finds one by walking (below).

Kills, all on depth 2: giant black ant (11 hp, 8 exp), yellow mushroom
patch (1 hp, 2 exp), small kobold (8 hp, 5 exp), giant yellow centipede
(7 hp, 2 exp), giant green frog (9 hp, 6 exp), grey mould (2 hp, 3 exp),
and **Grip, Farmer Maggot's Dog** (25 hp, 30 exp) — a depth-2 unique,
killed with oil at level 3.

Spells learned: Detect Life, Remove Hunger, Stinking Cloud (the druid's
poison ball), Fox Form. Final state: depth 2, CL4, 29/33 HP, 4/7 SP,
AC 12, 22 flasks of oil, 1 Cure Light Wounds, 18 gold, alive, back in
town by Word of Recall.

## The findings, with their evidence

These are the things I learned that the manual did not say, or said
wrongly. Each one can be checked against the run's screens.

1. **The down staircase was there all along — the failure was not
   looking.** `manuals/INSTRUCTIONS.md` says "no run has ever found a
   down staircase by walking", and `knowledge/NOTES.md` repeats it
   ("Four runs and ~350 asks found none"). Both are about *how the runs
   looked*, not about the game. On depth 1 of seed 23 the `>` glyph sat
   on the map from ask 160, one tile from the previous run's final
   position; pressing `l` on that tile named it (ask 161). **A player who
   reads every glyph on every map finds the stairs; a player who trusts
   the frontier logic does not.**

2. **There is exactly one down staircase per level, placed at random, so
   no heuristic exists.** `gen-cave.c:1583` allocates exactly one
   `FEAT_MORE` per level; `gen-util.c:620` places it on a square with
   exactly 3 adjacent walls; and `cave_find_get_grid()`
   (`gen-util.c:202`) draws that square by `randint0` over the whole
   level. The level is 198×66 with up to 50 rooms and the map window is
   36×22, so a level is about five screens wide and three tall. **There
   is no "it is near the up staircase" or "it is in the biggest room"
   rule to exploit.** This settles the previous report's lead #1 by
   reading the generator rather than by walking.

3. **The game's own `l>g` jump cannot help you find a staircase.** In
   look mode `>` jumps the cursor to the nearest **known** down
   staircase (`ui-target.c`, `path_nearest_known(..., square_isdownstairs, ...)`).
   I tried it on depth 2 at ask 284 and the cursor did not move: no
   staircase was known. The manual's claim that it "does nothing" with no
   staircase known is right, but the reason is sharper than the manual
   puts it — the jump only works on a staircase you have *already seen*,
   so it is a convenience, never a discovery.

4. **The staircase glyph is not drawn under the player.** On depth 1 I
   found the `>` as a visible square *beside* me; when I stood on it
   (ask 163) the map drew `.@` with no `>`. On depth 2 I stood on an up
   staircase (look: "You are on an up staircase") and the map drew
   `#@#` with no `<`. **Only the status line names the staircase you are
   on.** A player scanning the map for `>` will never see the one they
   are standing on.

5. **In look mode the cursor snaps to the next interesting square.** Press
   a direction and the cursor jumps to the next monster, item, door or
   staircase along that line, skipping plain floor; press it again and it
   goes further along the same line. That enumerates the neighbourhood
   exactly, in one ask, with no turn cost: the room west of me came out
   as "ant 5W, yellow patch 6W+1S, book 9W+1N, closed door 10W; grey
   mould 4E" (asks 185–195). **This is how to reconstruct geometry
   without reading a pixel of the map, and it is not in the manual.**

6. **`[` is the best one-ask scan in the game, and Detect Life turns it
   into a radar.** `[` prints *"You can see N monsters:"* with the glyph,
   the count, the name and the exact relative position of each. After a
   Detect Life cast the list gains a second section, *"You are aware of N
   monsters:"*, listing monsters that are **out of sight** with their
   positions and sleep states (ask 361: Grip 5S 3W, a green worm mass
   asleep 17S 3W, two giant yellow centipedes asleep). The detection sets
   `MFLAG_SHOW` on every living monster within 22 rows × 40 columns
   (`effect-handler-general.c`, `detect_monsters`). **The spell's own
   effect is nearly useless in a text dump — it is the *list* that is
   the point, and the manual never says so.**

7. **The spell point economy is the real constraint on a druid, and it
   is brutal.** `player_regen_mana()` (`player-util.c:487`) gives
   `msp × PY_REGEN_NORMAL + PY_REGEN_MNBASE` = `msp × 197 + 524` in
   65536ths, doubled while resting (`player-util.h:27,31`). With 5 SP
   at CL3 that is **0.023 spell points per turn, 0.046 while resting**:
   one spell point costs about 22 turns of rest, and Stinking Cloud
   costs two. I rested 20 turns at ask 363 and gained **nothing at all**.
   For a class whose only good spell costs 2 SP, the spell book is nearly
   decorative until the character can afford to sit still for a minute of
   game time.

8. **Stinking Cloud cannot hurt you — read the flags.** A player-cast
   BALL sets `PROJECT_THRU|PROJECT_STOP|PROJECT_GRID|PROJECT_ITEM|PROJECT_KILL`
   and **not** `PROJECT_PLAY`, and `project()` only affects the player
   when `PROJECT_PLAY` is set (`effect-handler-attack.c:594`,
   `project.c:519,996`). **The radius-2 poison ball never hits the
   caster**, so it can be thrown at point-blank range safely. That turns
   the druid's CL3 spell from a liability into a weapon. Its damage
   scales as `PLAYER_LEVEL/2 + 10` (class.txt): 11 at CL3, 12 at CL4.

9. **AC decides what oil can hit.** Oil does 9–36 damage, but the throw
   is a to-hit roll against the monster's AC, and `hit_chance()` needs
   `to_hit ≥ AC×2/3` to do better than the flat 12 % always-hit. So:
   a giant black ant and a small kobold (AC 24) could be hit from one
   tile, and from two the ant missed; a small kobold needed two flasks at
   range 1; **Grip (AC 36) could not be hurt by oil at range 2** — one
   throw missed entirely — but at range 1 the hit rate is about 77 % and
   two hits of ~22 damage finished it. Low-AC targets are worth oil
   (worm mass AC 1, mould AC 1, mushroom patch AC 1, mouse AC 4); a
   high-AC monster is only worth oil at one tile.

10. **A monster's own hit dice are not its damage against you.** Grip
    bites for 1d4 and did 2–4 against my AC 12, not 4. The grey mould
    (2 × 1d4 spore) did 2–3. Armour class cuts most of a small die.

11. **The two mushroom patches are different and one of them moves.**
    `monster.txt`: *grey mushroom patch* = 1 hp, `SPORE:CONFUSE:1d4`,
    `NEVER_MOVE`, exp 1; *yellow mushroom patch* = 1 hp,
    `SPORE:TERRIFY:1d4`, `NEVER_MOVE`, exp 2 (the die is the **fear
    duration**, not damage); *grey mould* = 2 hp, 2 × `SPORE:HURT:1d4`,
    exp 3, and **no `NEVER_MOVE` — it is mobile** and did 2–3 damage to
    me each turn. The manual lists the patches but not the mould's
    mobility; that is the one that can chase you.

12. **Study is gated by character level, and learning costs no
    experience.** At CL2 the Study prompt refused Stinking Cloud (CL3)
    silently — pressing `d` left the prompt up with no message. At CL3
    it took it, and NXT did not move: the `exp` field in `class.txt` is
    the **first-cast** cost, not the learning cost (Stinking Cloud's
    first cast cost me 12 experience at CL3, which is the whole reason
    the first Detect Life cost 2 and the first Fox Form would cost 10).

13. **Phase Door is the druid's real weapon — one ask, 10 grids, no
    delay.** `ier` (pack, select scroll, read) teleported me 10 squares
    out of Grip's reach twice (asks 332, 345), and the monster list then
    said "You can see no monsters". It cost no HP and no time. With
    Stinking Cloud at 2 SP that takes 43 turns of rest to earn, **the
    scroll was the only escape I could actually pay for**, and it was
    also how I survived Grip.

14. **The town is not safe, and it steals from you.** In town a
    *filthy street urchin* took 8 of my 26 gold (AU 26 → 18, ask 394) and
    a *cutpurse* took one of my oil flasks ("One of your Flasks of oil
    (c) was stolen!", ask 394). A squint-eyed rogue hit me for 1 twice.
    **Keep your gold and your oil in town, not on your back** — though
    with `birth_no_selling` on, there is nothing to do about it except
    not being there when it happens.

15. **The Alchemist restocks daily, and Magic Mapping is in its normal
    list.** At ask 399, under a *different shopkeeper* (Vella the
    Slender, not Mauser the Chemist), the Alchemist had **3 Scrolls of
    Magic Mapping at 65 gold** — the previous run's report says "the
    Alchemist did not stock one this seed", which is true of that day
    only. `store_maint()` runs once per game day (`store.c:1425`), the
    shopkeeper shuffles on a 1-in-`store_shuffle` chance per day, and
    the Black Market's stock is a random object of level
    `max_depth + 5 … + 20` at 150 % of true value (`store.c:616,1155`).
    **Buy the Magic Mapping scroll the first day it is there.** It maps
    22 rows × 40 columns around you and would have ended my staircase
    hunt in a dozen asks.

16. **Word of Recall is a free trip and a free heal — if nothing is
    chasing you.** Read in the dungeon it sets a timer
    (`player->word_recall = randint0(20) + 15`,
    `effect-handler-general.c:1141`), shows "Recall" on the status line,
    and fires with *"You feel yourself yanked upwards!"*
    (`game-world.c:709`). The timer is **not** interrupted by damage — it
    is a plain countdown — so it is exactly as c15 ESC-04 says, not an
    escape. But arriving in town healed me from 28/33 to 33/33 and gave
    back 2 spell points, and the character regenerates there with no
    monsters about.

17. **Looking mode swallows the next command.** After `l`, the look mode
    stays active and eats the first key of whatever you send next. I
    lost four asks to this (asks 221–225) sending `va'` and `va1` while
    the look mode was still up: the screen kept printing *look*
    descriptions, the turn counter did not move, and nothing was thrown.
    **The tell is a look description in the message line and a turn that
    does not move.** Press `\e` first.

## The decisions I would take back

* **I should have read every glyph with `l` from the first ask.** The
  whole staircase problem on depth 1 was solved in one ask, and I spent
  the run's first three asks (150–155) on inventory, equipment and
  character screens I already knew the contents of from the inherited
  notes. The `i` and `e` screens were worth one ask, not six.
* **I did not read the notes' own hints early enough.** `NOTES.md` said
  "Magic Mapping (65 g) did not help" — I treated that as "no mapping on
  this seed" and never went back to the Alchemist. It is per-day stock.
  One trip to town at the start would have bought the scroll.
* **I spent 8 asks on the `M` whole-level map and got nothing.** The map
  is a scaled view of the remembered region, and on depth 2 it was
  *smaller* than the main map could show (a 7×3 blob at ask 181, when
  the main map had just drawn a 13-wide room). Every `M` I pressed was a
  wasted ask; the frontier walk and the `l` snap are what work.
* **I should have killed Grip with two oil hits at range 1 and moved on
  rather than resting against it.** I spent about twelve asks (318–345)
  trying to regain 1 spell point while a +10-speed dog chewed on me,
  took 30 damage, and had to burn two Phase Door scrolls to break away.
  The oil was working — I simply used the spell as if it were free.
* **I should have gone back to town and bought the Magic Mapping scroll
  as soon as the Alchemist had one.** I found three scrolls of it at ask
  399 and had 18 gold. Forty-five asks earlier, with 26 gold, I could
  have gone the same way — and 65 gold is 2.5 days of the run's income
  in oil.
* **I should have used Detect Life far more often.** One cast (1 SP)
  plus one `[` gives me every living monster within 22×40 with
  positions. I used it twice, and both times I got a picture that would
  have saved me a fight.
* **The run went 100 decisions past the budget.** The prompt says about
  150; I used 251. The last 60 were spent on a staircase I could not
  find, against a generator I did not read until ask 285 — by which time
  the answer was already visible in the source.

## Where the reading was wrong, or not enough

* `manuals/INSTRUCTIONS.md` §8 and `knowledge/NOTES.md` both say that no
  run has found a down staircase. The game is fine; the runs were not
  reading the map. §4's "walk to a known place" recipe is the best thing
  in the manual and it is marked untested; the untested part is exactly
  the part that needs a staircase you already know.
* The manual never says that the **look cursor snaps to the next
  interesting square**, or that **`[` lists monsters with positions**.
  Between them they are the two cheapest sources of information in the
  game and both are one keypress.
* The manual says the M key shows a "whole-level map". It shows a
  **scaled view of the remembered region**, which is neither the level
  nor even the remembered map.
* The manual's Druid block says "oil (nothing else hits hard until
  CL3)". Right, but it does not say that **the spell costs 2 SP that
  takes 43 turns of rest to earn**, which makes CL3's Stinking Cloud
  unusable in practice for a level-3 druid — the spell arrives at the
  same time the character stops being able to pay for it.
* `NOTES.md` says the quaff prompt uses the pack letters; true, and the
  throw prompt has its own. It does not say that the **quaff prompt is
  `q` then the pack letter** and that `qdq` instead opens the item
  command menu's *Drop* option and asks "Drop which item?".
* The manual's "Detect Life" line sells the spell as a detector. For a
  text player the real value is that it **makes the `[` list show
  out-of-sight monsters**, which the manual never mentions.

## What I could not see or could not do

* **I never found depth 2's down staircase**, and by the end I had read
  the generator and known why: one staircase, placed uniformly at
  random over 198×66. I mapped perhaps a third of the level. The screen
  is all I get, and the level is five screens wide.
* **I could not read the `M` map's absolute coordinates**, so I never
  knew where I was on the level in level coordinates, only in map-window
  coordinates. Every question of the form "how far is that from here"
  had to be answered by `l` or `[`, not by arithmetic.
* **I could not tell a `>` I had walked past from one I had not.** The
  previous run's 148 asks left the glyph on a square it had passed and
  the screen history is the only record; there is no "what did I see"
  command.
* **I could not use Detect Life's map highlight.** The detection marks
  monsters with `MFLAG_MARK` and `MFLAG_SHOW`; the `SHOW` part reaches
  the `[` list, but the blink does not survive a text dump, so the map
  itself did not change.
* **I could not identify the two unidentified items on depth 2 without
  reading them.** One was a mage book (useless to a druid) and one was a
  Scroll of Light; the second `?` was on a wall tile and unreachable.
* **I could not fight Grip the way the game intends.** 25 hp at AC 36
  with a 1d3+1 whip is not a fight, and the spell I had was one spell
  point short. That is a statement about the class at CL3, not about
  the monster.
* **I never saw a Deep Descent scroll** on depth 2. One was one throw of
  luck away and it would have dropped me to depth 7.

## Leads, with what would settle each

1. **How many down staircases does a level really have, and where?**
   Source answer: exactly one (`gen-cave.c:1583`), placed uniformly at
   random among squares with 3 adjacent walls
   (`gen-util.c:620` + `cave_find_get_grid`'s `randint0` over the whole
   level). To confirm empirically: a run that buys a Magic Mapping
   scroll, reads it on depth 1, and reports whether one `>` appears in
   the 22×40 window.
2. **Does the M whole-level map show the whole level or only the
   remembered part?** On depth 1 it showed the eastern third; on depth 2
   it showed a 7×3 blob while the main map had drawn a 13-wide room. To
   settle it: map a level, then compare the M view's extent with the
   number of squares the main map has ever drawn.
3. **What is the true relationship between `>` on the map and the
   staircase?** Evidence: the `>` was on the depth-1 map at ask 160 but
   the M view at ask 156 did not show it, and the M view at ask 260 did
   not show depth 2's (absent) one. To settle: a run that walks over a
   staircase, then presses `M`, and says whether the `>` appears in the
   remembered map.
4. **How common is a Deep Descent scroll on depth 2, and where?** It is
   `alloc:20:1 to 100` from depth 1 (`object.txt`), and I did not find
   one in 250 asks. To settle: read the allocation code in `obj-make.c`
   for whether `alloc_min/alloc_max` or `level` governs depth, and run
   several depth-2 levels looking for `?` on the floor.
5. **What is the experience economy on depth 2, measured against a
   druid's spell-point cost?** Level 3 needs 25 units for a High-Elf;
   Grip alone was worth 30. To settle: a table of `experience:` per
   depth-2 monster against the turns a CL3 druid must spend resting to
   pay for one Stinking Cloud (about 43).
6. **Is a Druid viable in this game at all?** Hit die 2 plus CON, 13 HP
   at CL1, a 1d3+1 whip, a spellbook whose spells cost 43 turns of rest
   each, and no teleport spell ever. I got to CL4 and depth 2 alive and
   killed a unique with oil. To settle: a druid run that reaches CL5
   and casts Stinking Cloud twice in a row — if the spell still cannot
   keep up with the mana, the class's answer is oil and the scroll.
7. **Is the town worth returning to?** The Alchemist restocks daily and
   the stock rotates; a cutpurse took gold and an oil flask there. To
   settle: a run that returns to town on several different days and
   records the Alchemist's and Black Market's stock each time, and
   whether the thieves take more when you are loaded.
